**Title:** Natural Language Processing

**Content:**
Carnot conducts research in NLP with the goal of making machines read, understand, and communicate in human language more effectively. We help organizations in deriving valuable insights hidden in unstructured data – text, email, customer reviews, social media, audio, images, and videos. Organizations can derive a number of benefits by integrating NLP capabilities into existing systems, like cost control, faster processing, and smoother integration of data analysis capabilities. NLP is especially useful for organizations that analyze or consume complex documents or texts, or rely on this process in some form.

**Images:**
There are two images present:
1. The first image, located to the right of the text, features a blue background with graphical representations of sound waves and a digital portrayal of a human face, suggesting themes of technology and cognition.
